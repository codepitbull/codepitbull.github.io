<p>My name is Jochen Mader, I am a married father of two, music addict, and lifelong geek.</p>

<p>I am part of the geek herd at <a href="http://codecentric.de">codecentric</a> where I am lucky enough to the things I love:
<ul>
	<li>Give talks (a lot of them)</li>
	<li>Write articles (almost as much)</li>
	<li>Give trainings (JVM, Resilience, Spring, Vert.x, ...)</li>
	<li>Work on interesting stuff (stream processing, reactive programming, microservices, big data, ...)</li>
	<li>be as agile as possible</li>
</ul>
</p>

This blog is going to be my central publication hub. I want to collect all the posts I made in various publications over the past few years in a central place. There will also be the occasional blog post on random things I couldn't figure out to put somewhere else.
