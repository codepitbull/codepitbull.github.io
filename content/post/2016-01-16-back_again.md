Welcome to the 3rd iteration of my blog. 

I've been very busy during the past few years writing for a lot of different publications. For some reasons I never really kept track of the things I published in all these different places. After trying to compile a list I figured it might be worth to collect my stuff for later reference.

This won't be another attempt to create a well maintained blog. There will be only a few _"blog-exclusive"_-posts as I am going to continue to write mostly on the [codecentric-blog](https://blog.codecentric.de/). 

Maybe, if I got some spare time, I will merge my old articles from my [wordpress-blog](https://codepitbull.wordpress.com/) but I am not really sure if it's worth the effort.
