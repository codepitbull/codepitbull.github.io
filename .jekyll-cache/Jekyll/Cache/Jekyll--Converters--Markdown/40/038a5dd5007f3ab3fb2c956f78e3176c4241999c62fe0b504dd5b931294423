I"<p>Welcome to the 3rd iteration of my blog.</p>

<p>I’ve been very busy during the past few years writing for a lot of different publications. For some reasons I never really kept track of the things I published in all these different places. After trying to compile a list I figured it might be worth to collect my stuff for later reference.</p>

<p>This won’t be another attempt to create a well maintained blog. There will be only a few <em>“blog-exclusive”</em>-posts as I am going to continue to write mostly on the <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/">codecentric-blog</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe, if I got some spare time, I will merge my old articles from my <a href="https://codepitbull.wordpress.com/">wordpress-blog</a> but I am not really sure if it’s worth the effort.</p>
